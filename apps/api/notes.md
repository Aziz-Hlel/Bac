                     // when using the builder pattern. Without it, the builder overrides your

<!-- in the mapper layer, you should still verify if the object is nulland here s the reasons  -->
⚠️ Why Still Do the Null Check in the Mapper?
MapStruct is a low-level transformation layer.
It may be reused in contexts other than HTTP (e.g., unit tests, background jobs, etc.), where you can’t guarantee input is valid or initialized.

Future-proofing.
Someone might bypass controller validation, or the validation contract might change. If you don’t guard the mapper, it becomes a hidden bug surface.

Fail-safe principle (aka defensive programming).
At the mapper level, don’t assume anything. Always validate your inputs.

✔️ Why both? (meaning validation and null condition)
Validation prevents invalid API calls.
Null checks protect against developer misuse or internal bugs.


# java
default List<SchoolMajors> toEntityList(List<SchoolMajorsRequest> requests, UUID schoolId) {
    if (requests == null || requests.isEmpty()) { // always add these type of conditions
        return List.of();
    }
    return requests.stream()
                   .map(req -> toEntity(req, schoolId))
                   .toList();
}
